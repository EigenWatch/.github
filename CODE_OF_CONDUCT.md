# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the EigenWatch community pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone—regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inspiring community for all contributors.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and empathetic toward others
- Using inclusive and thoughtful language
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information (doxxing)
- Any conduct that could be reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all organization spaces—both online and offline—including GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, social media, and other community spaces.

## Enforcement
